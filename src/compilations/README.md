Be prepared to be blown away, quite literally. No, like seriously, your browser might have a hard time viewing the compiled files. It is recommended to download (& verify!) the latest release from [here](www.google.com)

> Verify the release?! (ï¿¢ï¿¢)?
> 
> Yes -- it is advised to verify the authenticity of any file we download off the internet, even if it was downloaded from trusted sources. here's 
> how to do just that!
> 
> 1. **The ready-made method**: I have already included a script that simply verifies your `compiled.prodXX.json` file for you!
> 		- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system before attempting to run the script.
> 			- (Tested on Node v16, but should work on higher versions)
> 		- Run `node verifyCompile.js` & you should be good to go.
> 		
> 2. **The manual method**: This is for more the techygeeks ~~that just can't get enough hours infront of a display~~
> 		- I will always include the `sha256` hash (usually) in the same page that you downloaded the recent release from.
> 			- For Linux users, you can simply run the `sha256sum` command and you'll be rolling! ([Baeldung has a great guide about this here](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sha-256-from-command-line))

Have fun!

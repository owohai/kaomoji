A huge, non-exhaustive list of Kaomoji. („Å£Ôºæ‚ñøÔºæ)üí®

### ...aand, why?
I love sprinkling kaomoji on litreally anything I make (just look at my GitHub repositories). kaomoji has so many uses and I cannot emphasise how much flavor it adds to your projects. Okay, this is starting to sound more like a baking recipe (/œâÔºº)

The current list of kaomoji which is available at [`src/compilations`](https://github.com/owohai/kaomoji/tree/main/src/compilations) was mostly scrapped from many sources which I have listed at the [bottom](https://github.com/owohai/kaomoji/edit/main/README.md#soruces) of this readme. This project would never have been possible without then and I extend my appreciation to them.

Yes, an there will be an NPM package for this. It is infact in the works and should be accesible at the NPM branch of this repo. I also host an API for obataining kaomoji (& and other goodies) which is documented here. 

## features

- categorised kaomoji 
- huge (and I really mean it -- over **4800k** lines!) amounts of kaomoji
- not too storage-heavy, coming in at just `144 kilobytes` in its full unzipped form

## API
First of all, thank you for the intrest in the API! (‚úßu‚úß) It means a lot to me

Each request is capped at a maximum of **100** requests a minute. Time to get into things! oh, by the way: the rest API is available at https://kao.moe

```
GET /k/routes
```
Returns a list of possible routes 

## contributing

follow the template issue's steps. I recommend that you do not:

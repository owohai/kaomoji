A huge, non-exhaustive list of Kaomoji. (っ＾▿＾)💨

### ...aand, why?
I love sprinkling kaomoji on litreally anything I make (just look at my GitHub repositories). kaomoji has so many uses and I cannot emphasise how much flavor it adds to your projects. Okay, this is starting to sound more like a baking recipe (/ω＼)

The current list of kaomoji which is available at [`src/compilations`](https://github.com/owohai/kaomoji/tree/main/src/compilations) was mostly scrapped from many sources which I have listed at the bottom of this readme. This project would never have been possible without then and and extend my apperceptions to them. 

## Features

- categorised kaomoji 
- huge (and I really mean it -- over **4800k** lines!) amounts of kaomoji
- not too storage-heavy, coming in at just `144 kilobytes` in its full unzipped form

## contributing

thank in you in advance for any contributions you may come along with. ヘ(￣ω￣ヘ)

follow the template issue's steps. I recommend that you do not:
> Suggest kaomoji that signifies the following:
> - offensive remarks to any race, sexuality or religon
> - nsfw or suggestive kaomoji
> - biased towards any country or individual
> - protests or real-life issues
> 
> or Suggest kaomoji that can mess with rendering on certain devices.

while the list above may not be fully inclusive, I hope that you might put just a *little* of common sense towards opening a new issue.
